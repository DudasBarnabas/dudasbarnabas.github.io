- This is a demo version of the experiment lootbox experiment.
  [https://dudasbarnabas.herokuapp.com/demo/lootbox_game_demo](https://dudasbarnabas.herokuapp.com/demo/lootbox_game_demo)
- This version is made to present the different lootbox designs made for the experiment in a quick and effective way. In order to do that we removed parts of the original experiment leaving us with 3 public-goods rounds. The rest we kept intact to best replicate the experience.
- The demo begins with 3 public-goods rounds, in these the contribution of the algorithm driven "players" can be followed, which wasn't possible during the real experiment. The first link on the demo page (P1) imitates the group with high cooperation, the second link (P2) imitates the group with low cooperation.
- After these rounds the player's coins will be set to an even 1000 so all lootboxes can be purchased without any issue.
- The lootboxes are presented in the same order, the lootboxes or the outcomes are not modified. After the 5 lootboxes the demo ends.
  The scores at the end are not realistic, tickets won't be calculated and players won't be entered into the raffle by completing the demo. Data is not stored.
